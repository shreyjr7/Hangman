# Hangman
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a secret word and the other guesses letters one at a time. The secret word is represented by dashes, and each correctly guessed letter fills in the corresponding spaces. For every incorrect guess, a part of a stick-figure man is drawn.
